ListView
--------------------------------

In Android development, any time we want to show a vertical list of scrollable items 
we will use a ListView which has data populated using an Adapter. 
The simplest adapter to use is called an ArrayAdapter because 
the adapter converts an ArrayList of objects into View items loaded into the ListView container.

ArrayAdpater
-------------------------------------
The ArrayAdapter fits in between an ArrayList (data source) and the ListView (visual representation) and configures two aspects:

Which array to use as the data source for the list
How to convert any given item in the array into a corresponding View object.....

Row View Recycling
--------------------------------------
ListView asks adapter 
1--“give me a view” (getView) for each item of the list
2--A new View is returned and displayed
